;; How many requests does a work tree cost, per block and packed?

;; The homework in superproject ADR-2608198000 / cloud-itonami-app ADR-0057:
;; that store issues **one request per block**, and ADR-0057 wrote down what
;; that costs for a single large upload (a 100 MiB file is 400 leaves plus 3
;; nodes) while leaving the shape a bot actually writes -- a tree of many small
;; files -- unmeasured.
;;
;; This counts it. Nothing here talks to a network: the request count of a
;; block-per-object store is a function of the block set, so counting blocks is
;; exact rather than an estimate. What it is NOT is a latency measurement.
;; ADR-2608198000 says the indicator is the number of round trips; this reports
;; that number and no other.
;;
;; The tree comes from `git ls-files` when the directory is a repository,
;; because a work tree is git-managed by definition in the design this
;; measures, and `.git` and `node_modules` are not part of what a bot commits.
