  "Replaying a selector against a CAR, and the five ways that must fail.

  The producer (`selection-car`) may trust its own store. The verifier may
  trust nothing: not the archive's roots header, not its frame CIDs, and not
  that it carries everything the traversal needs. Each of those is silent by
  default -- `car/decode` keys blocks by the CID the frame declares and never
  rehashes them -- so each gets a case here.

  The fixtures are the four ADR-2609060000 names: missing blocks, shared
  links, unsupported forms, and limits."
