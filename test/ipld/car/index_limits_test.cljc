  "What the index decoder does with counts it cannot honour.

  Every count in MultihashIndexSorted is read from the archive, so a reader
  that trusts them does work the file did not pay for. The cases below are
  the three shapes that reach a reader over a network: a truncated fetch, a
  count larger than the bytes that follow, and a well-formed index larger
  than the caller will hold.

  The measurement that made these necessary (2026-09-06, nbb): a truncated
  index did not fail -- `read-u32-le` past the end returned `NaN`, `(= j NaN)`
  was never true, and `decode` spun without yielding the event loop. It was
  not slow; it did not finish, and a `setTimeout` racing it never fired."
