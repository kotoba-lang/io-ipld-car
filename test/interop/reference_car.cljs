  "Cross-check against the reference implementation, `@ipld/car`.

  Every other test in this repository is this library agreeing with itself.
  That is worth having and it is not interoperability: a writer and a reader
  built from the same misreading of the spec agree perfectly. This suite is
  the only place where something that did not read our source decides whether
  the bytes are a CAR.

  Run:  npx nbb --classpath \"$(clojure -Spath)\" test/interop/reference_car.cljs

  It is nbb rather than a `.mjs` harness because this workspace writes Node
  test drivers in nbb (root CLAUDE.md), and because the same `.cljc` under
  test is what a Worker will run."
